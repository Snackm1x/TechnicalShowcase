# TechnicalShowcase

This is a console application that parses a JSON API for photo albums and displays them in the console.

A release version of the application can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B676zOSSbYg4WWY4LWhNc1o5YzQ

You will need to download the zip folder. Unzip the folder, and run the TechnicalShowcase.exe as an administrator.

Otherwise you may clone this repo and open the solution in Visual Studio. You should then be able to run the TechnicalShowcase project in debug mode and the application should launch from there as well. You can find the unit tests in the project AlbumTest and run those to ensure success. You will want to verify that the project AlbumTest has TechnicalShowcase listed as a dependancy.
